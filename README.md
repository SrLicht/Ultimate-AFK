# Ultimate-AFK
This plugin allows AFK players to be replaced by players who are in spectator, they can also be kicked from the server after a certain number of being detected as AFK (configurable).

# Features
- Detects AFK Players via in-game movement, camera movement
- Moves players to spectator after a determined AFK Time and grace period
- (Optional) Kick players from the server after repeated AFK detections!
- Custom broadcasts to AFK Players to indicate to them if they are AFK. 
- Works with SCP-079

# Permission
If you give a group the `uafk.ignore` permission the player will be ignored to replace a player and will also never be detected as AFK. Useful for administrators

# Installation
**This branch only works on Exiled 6.0.0-beta.24 or higher.**

Download the code and compile it yourself, or you can create a fork and release a version yourself, but be nice and credit the author.
